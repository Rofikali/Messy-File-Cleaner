# Engineering Skills Catalogue

This catalogue defines the knowledge required to build, review, secure, operate, and evolve the project. It is not a mandate to add every technology.

## Core implementation
- C17/C23, POSIX APIs, Linux syscalls, libc, errno, file descriptors
- Memory ownership, allocation, alignment, lifetime, undefined behavior
- Filesystem semantics: inode, directory entries, hardlinks, symlinks, mounts, rename, EXDEV, fsync
- CMake, Ninja, Make, compiler/linker flags, static analysis
- GDB, sanitizers, Valgrind, strace

## Architecture and design
- HLD, LLD, module boundaries, dependency direction, contracts
- SOLID adapted to C, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, clean code
- Modular monolith, selective Hexagonal Architecture, pipeline, producer-consumer
- Strategy, Adapter, Observer, State Machine, Command where justified
- API design, ABI compatibility, semantic versioning, deprecation
- DDD only where a meaningful domain model exists

## Data structures and concurrency
- Bounded ring buffers, SPSC/MPSC/MPMC queue contracts
- Hash tables, collision handling, path stacks, iterative DFS
- Complexity, cache locality, false sharing, memory pools
- C memory model, atomics, pthreads, mutexes, eventfd, inotify
- Backpressure, cancellation, shutdown, race detection
- Idempotency, journaling, crash consistency, recovery, fault injection

## Security
- Threat modeling, trust boundaries, path traversal, symlink attacks, TOCTOU
- Special files, permissions, least privilege, Linux capabilities and namespaces
- Input validation, integer overflow, bounds checking, secure temporary files
- Supply-chain security, dependency review, SBOM, vulnerability management

## Performance and interoperability
- Benchmark design, perf, flame graphs, strace -c
- CPU vs I/O analysis, page cache, filesystem and storage behavior
- Compiler optimization, LTO, PGO, vectorization, SIMD
- Latency percentiles, throughput, memory peak, syscall count
- Public C headers, stable C ABI, Rust FFI, extern C, repr(C), opaque handles
- Ownership transfer, allocator boundaries, panic containment, shared/static libraries

## Delivery, operations, and management
- Docker multi-stage builds, Compose, non-root containers, read-only root, volume permissions
- GitHub Actions, clean builds, CI gates, release artifacts
- Logging, metrics, incident diagnosis, recovery runbooks
- Customer validation, MVP scope, build-vs-buy, total cost, release planning, risk register, quality metrics, ROI

## Milestone delivery and merge governance
- Scope and acceptance-criteria definition for independent milestones
- Branch-per-milestone workflow, PR review, CI evidence, security sign-off
- Merge each passed milestone into main before beginning the next
- Verify merge commit and main-branch checks; never claim an unconfirmed merge
- Handle failed gates in the same milestone instead of advancing

## Nanosecond-aware performance engineering
- Distinguish clock resolution, measurement precision, and actual operation latency
- Use monotonic clocks and batched microbenchmarks to amortize timer overhead
- Measure median, p95, p99, throughput, variance, and warm/cold filesystem cases
- Optimize nanosecond-scale CPU-bound paths only when repeatable evidence supports it
- Do not promise nanosecond end-to-end file moves; report filesystem and durability costs honestly

## Learning and implementation cycle
1. Explain the concept in plain language.
2. Identify the concrete repository problem it solves.
3. Implement the smallest safe example.
4. Add automated tests.
5. Measure or review the result.
6. Document the decision and limitations.

Do not add technology merely to make the architecture look advanced.

## Filesystem path boundary validation
- Validate destination configuration as untrusted input.
- Canonicalize input roots and compare path components safely (not string-prefix-only checks).
- Test root/output overlap, symlink roots, symlink destinations, reserved journal paths, and forced-root behavior in temporary directories.


## Mandatory project language: pure C

The owner has selected **pure C** for this project. This is a firm constraint, not an open C-versus-C++ evaluation.

- Core implementation, tests, native tools, and product build targets use C only.
- Never add C++ source files (`.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`), C++ classes/templates/exceptions/STL, C++ runtime dependencies, or CXX build targets.
- C17 is the default; C11 compatibility is maintained where practical; C23 is an optional compatibility target after toolchain validation.
- Use explicit C interfaces, opaque handles where useful, clear ownership/lifetime contracts, and modular boundaries.
- Interoperability uses a stable, documented C ABI. It does not justify a C++ rewrite.
- Assembly is allowed only as an isolated, benchmark-justified optimization with a portable and tested C fallback.
- Do not add Rust or another implementation language to the core without an explicit owner decision and documented review.

When a proposed design or tool suggests C++, translate the design into idiomatic, safe, maintainable C instead.
